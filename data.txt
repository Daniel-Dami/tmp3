# 1. Introduction
## 1.1 Setting the Stage
The story unfolds in the bustling metropolis of New York City, a place where dreams are made and broken in equal measure. The city's skyline, a jagged testament to human ambition, pierces the sky with its towering spires and glass structures. The streets are a labyrinth of concrete and asphalt, echoing with the ceaseless hum of traffic and the chatter of millions of souls. It is a city of contrasts, where the opulent and the destitute live side by side, often invisible to each other.

New York is a city that never sleeps, and its heartbeat is as varied as the people who call it home. From the bright lights of Times Square to the quiet solitude of Central Park at dawn, the city offers a backdrop for stories both grand and intimate. It is a place where the relentless pursuit of success is the norm, and the scent of opportunity permeates the air.

## 1.2 Introducing the Main Character
Meet Alex Thompson, a young and ambitious journalist with a passion for uncovering the truth. Alex is a man of average height, with a lean build that speaks of long hours spent hunched over a keyboard or chasing leads through the city. His eyes are a piercing blue, always keen and alert, betraying a mind that rarely rests. His dark hair is perpetually tousled, as if he's just run his hands through it in frustration or excitement.

Alex is a man of principles, with a strong sense of justice that often leads him down dangerous paths. He is not one to back down from a challenge, and his determination has earned him a reputation for being both tenacious and fearless. However, his dedication to his work has come at a cost, leaving little room for personal relationships or leisure.

Born and raised in a small town in Kansas, Alex was always the outsider, yearning for something more than the quiet life the town had to offer. His curiosity and thirst for knowledge led him to the city, where he quickly became enamored with its energy and possibilities. Now, as a reporter for one of the city's most respected newspapers, Alex is on the cusp of a story that could make or break his career.

## 2.1 Incident that triggers the story
On a seemingly ordinary day, Alex receives an anonymous tip that sets his investigative instincts buzzing. The message contains a cryptic clue about a massive corporate scandal, one that could expose the corrupt underbelly of New York's financial district. The tip alludes to a shadowy network of power and deceit, involving some of the city's most influential figures.

The clue is a photograph of a man, his face partially obscured, handing over a briefcase to another individual in a nondescript alley. The image is grainy, taken from a distance, but the exchange appears furtive, suggesting something illicit. The message accompanying the photo reads, "The truth lies in the shadows. Follow the money."

## 2.2 The main character's initial reaction
Alex's initial reaction is a mix of skepticism and excitement. He's been in the business long enough to know that not all leads pan out, but the thrill of the chase is undeniable. He studies the photograph, committing every detail to memory. The man's expensive suit, the briefcase's worn handle, the glint of something that could be a camera lens in the background attatch detail is a potential breadcrumb on the path to the truth.

Driven by his innate curiosity and the promise of a groundbreaking story, Alex begins to dig. He starts by running a background check on the man in the photograph, using his connections within the police department to access databases and public records. His search yields a name: Richard Kane, a high-ranking executive at a multinational corporation with a spotless reputation.

Alex's journalistic instincts tell him that Kane's involvement is no coincidence. He becomes obsessed with uncovering the connection between Kane and the mysterious briefcase exchange. He spends long nights poring over financial records, searching for discrepancies, and interviewing sources who might have insight into Kane's business dealings.

As he delves deeper, Alex starts to notice a pattern of transactions that seem to defy logic, a web of shell companies and offshore accounts that hint at money laundering on a grand scale. Each revelation fuels his determination, but it also raises the stakes. He knows that if he's not careful, he could become a target himself.
# 3. Development
## 3.1 Subplots and Secondary Characters

As Alex delves into the corporate scandal, several subplots emerge, each with its own cast of secondary characters that add depth and complexity to the story.

**The Whistleblower**: A key subplot revolves around the anonymous whistleblower who initially tipped off Alex. As Alex tries to uncover the identity of this individual, he meets Sarah, a tech-savvy journalist who has been investigating the same corporation. Sarah becomes a valuable ally, providing Alex with crucial information and a new perspective on the case.

**The Corporate Rival**: Another subplot introduces Marcus, a rival journalist who is also chasing the story. Marcus is ruthless and will stop at nothing to get the scoop, creating a tense rivalry between the two reporters. This subplot adds a layer of personal conflict and urgency to Alex's quest for the truth.

**The Insider**: Alex's investigation leads him to Laura, an employee within the corporation who has her own reasons for wanting to expose the scandal. She becomes a critical source of information for Alex, but her involvement puts her job and safety at risk, adding a moral dilemma to the story.

**The Political Angle**: As the scandal widens, it becomes clear that the corruption extends to political figures. Alex interviews a seasoned politician, Mayor Richardson, who is running for re-election and is implicated in the scandal. The mayor's involvement introduces a political subplot that explores themes of power, corruption, and the ethical compromises made in the pursuit of political success.

## 3.2 Main Character's Growth

Throughout the development of the story, Alex undergoes significant personal growth. His initial skepticism gives way to a deep sense of moral responsibility as he realizes the far-reaching implications of the scandal.

**Mental Fortitude**: The pressure of the investigation takes a toll on Alex's mental health. He experiences sleepless nights, constant anxiety, and moments of self-doubt. However, these challenges force him to confront his own fears and insecurities, ultimately strengthening his resolve.

**Relationships**: Alex's obsession with the case initially strains his relationships with his colleagues and loved ones. However, as the story progresses, he learns to trust and rely on others, particularly Sarah, Laura, and even Marcus to some extent. These relationships become a source of support and a reminder of the importance of collaboration.

**Ethical Awakening**: The corporate scandal exposes Alex to the harsh realities of corporate greed and the cost of integrity. He is forced to question his own values and the ethics of journalism. This journey leads to a profound ethical awakening, where Alex decides that the pursuit of truth is worth any personal sacrifice.

**Physical Challenges**: As the stakes get higher, so does the danger. Alex faces physical threats from those who want to keep the scandal buried. These challenges test his courage and resourcefulness, pushing him to his limits and forcing him to rely on his instincts and quick thinking.

**Professional Triumph**: Despite the personal costs, Alex's growth is marked by professional triumph. His dogged pursuit of the truth leads to a series of exposes that shake the city and bring the corrupt to justice. His work earns him recognition and respect within the journalism community, solidifying his reputation as a fearless investigator.

By the end of this chapter, Alex emerges as a more seasoned and complex character, having navigated the treacherous waters of a high-stakes investigation and come out the other side with his integrity intact but forever changed by the experience.
# 4. Climax
## 4.1 The Turning Point
As Alex's investigation reaches its pinnacle, he uncovers a damning piece of evidence that could potentially implicate some of the city's most powerful individuals. The turning point comes when he discovers a hidden ledger detailing illegal transactions and bribes, linking the corporation to political figures and organized crime.

The ledger is the smoking gun Alex has been searching for, but its discovery comes at a great risk. He is now visible to those he has been pursuing, and they will stop at nothing to silence him. The realization that he has become a target himself forces Alex to make a critical decision: to go public with the information or to protect his own safety.

In a heart-pounding sequence, Alex is confronted by a mysterious figure who tries to intimidate him into dropping the story. The confrontation takes place in the shadows of an abandoned warehouse, with the city's skyline looming in the background. The figure, a high-ranking corporate executive, tries to bribe Alex with a lucrative job offer and threats of violence if he refuses.

## 4.2 High Stakes and Tension
The tension reaches its peak as Alex wrestles with the moral and personal implications of his discovery. The stakes are higher than ever, with the potential to expose a vast network of corruption that could shake the city to its core. Alex is torn between his duty as a journalist to reveal the truth and the very real threat to his life and the lives of those close to him.

As the pressure mounts, Alex finds himself in a race against time to authenticate the ledger and gather enough corroborating evidence to back up his claims. He enlists the help of Sarah and Laura, who work tirelessly alongside him to verify the information and prepare it for publication.

The tension is palpable as they work under the constant threat of being discovered. They are followed, their communications are intercepted, and their every move is watched. The sense of paranoia is heightened by the knowledge that their enemies are closing in.

In a dramatic turn of events, Alex is forced to go into hiding, leaving his usual life behind. He becomes a ghost in the city he once knew so well, moving from safe house to safe house, always one step ahead of his pursuers.

The climax of the story is a high-stakes game of cat and mouse, with Alex and his team working against the clock to bring the truth to light. The tension is relentless, and the reader is left on the edge of their seat, wondering if Alex will succeed in his mission or if the forces of corruption will prevail.

As the story reaches its boiling point, Alex makes a daring move to expose the scandal in a live television interview, risking everything for the sake of the truth. The interview becomes a national sensation, and the public outcry that follows forces the authorities to act, leading to a series of arrests and the beginning of the end for the corrupt network.

The climax of the story is a testament to Alex's courage and the power of journalism to hold the powerful accountable. It is a moment of truth, not just for the characters involved, but for the very soul of the city itself.
# 5. Falling Action
## 5.1 The Aftermath of the Climax
The aftermath of the climactic television interview is a whirlwind of activity. The city is gripped by the revelations, and the public outcry is deafening. Social media is ablaze with discussions, and the 24-hour news cycle is dominated by the scandal. Alex's name is on everyone's lips, and his face is now recognizable to the entire city.

The corporate and political worlds are in disarray as the implicated individuals scramble to either cover their tracks or distance themselves from the fallout. The authorities are under immense pressure to act swiftly and decisively, leading to a series of high-profile arrests and resignations. The city watches with bated breath as the dominos begin to fall, and the once untouchable figures are brought to justice.

For Alex, the aftermath is a mix of vindication and unease. His expos√© has sent shockwaves through the city, and he is hailed as a hero by some and a nuisance by others. He is flooded with requests for interviews, offers for book deals, and even threats from those who still have something to lose. The attention is both exhilarating and overwhelming, a stark contrast to the anonymity he once enjoyed.

## 5.2 The Main Character's Response

Their professional partnership evolves into a deep friendship, and they must navigate the complexities of their newfound fame together.

**Dealing with Fallout**: Alex is also dealing with the fallout within his own newspaper. His editor is both proud and wary of the attention the paper is receiving, and Alex is promoted to a more senior position. However, this promotion comes with its own set of challenges, as he is now responsible for a team of journalists and must balance his own investigative work with managerial duties.

As the dust begins to settle, Alex finds himself at the center of a new chapter in his life. He has emerged from the shadows a changed man, more aware of the power and responsibility that come with his profession. The city, too, is changed, forever marked by the events that have exposed its underbelly and forced it to confront its demons.

Alice was beginning to get very bored. She and her sister were sitting under the trees. Her sister was reading, but Alice had nothing to do. Once or twice she looked into her sister°Øs book, but it had no pictures or conversations in it.

     °ÆAnd what is the use of a book,°Ø thought Alice, °Æwithout pictures or conversations?°Ø

     She tried to think of something to do, but it was a hot day and she felt very sleepy and stupid. She was still sitting and thinking when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran past her.

Suddenly a White Rabbit ran past her

      There was nothing really strange about seeing a rabbit.  And Alice was not very surprised when the Rabbit said, °ÆOh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!°Ø (Perhaps it was a little strange, Alice thought later, but at the time she was not surprised.)

     But then the Rabbit took a watch out of its pocket, looked at it, and hurried on. At once Alice jumped to her feet.

      °ÆI°Øve never before seen a rabbit with either a pocket, or a watch to take out of it,°Ø she thought. And she ran quickly across the field after the Rabbit. She did not stop to think, and when the Rabbit ran down a large rabbit-hole, Alice followed it immediately.

     After a little way the rabbit-hole suddenly went down, deep into the ground. Alice could not stop herself falling, and down she went, too.

     It was a very strange hole. Alice was falling very slowly, and she had time to think and to look around her. She could see nothing below her because it was so dark. But when she looked at the sides of the hole, she could see cupboards and books and pictures on the walls.  She had time to take things out of a cupboard, look at them, and then put them back in a cupboard lower down.

     °ÆWell!°Ø thought Alice. °ÆAfter a fall like this, I can fall anywhere! I can fall downstairs at home, and I won°Øt cry or say a word about it!°Ø

      Down, down, down. °ÆHow far have I fallen now?°Ø Alice said aloud to herself. °ÆPerhaps I°Øm near the centre of the earth. Let me think °≠  That°Øs four thousand miles down.°Ø (Alice was very good at her school lessons and could remember a lot of things like this.)

      Down, down, down. Would she ever stop falling? Alice was very nearly asleep when, suddenly, she was sitting on the ground.  Quickly, she jumped to her feet and looked around. She could see the White Rabbit, who was hurrying away and still talking to himself. °ÆOh my ears and whiskers!°Ø he was saying. °ÆHow late it°Øs getting!°Ø

      Alice ran after him like the wind. She was getting very near him when he suddenly turned a corner. Alice ran round the corner too, and then stopped. She was now in a long, dark room with doors all round the walls, and she could not see the White Rabbit anywhere.

      She tried to open the doors, but they were all locked. °ÆHow will I ever get out again?°Ø she thought sadly. Then she saw a little glass table with three legs, and on the top of it was a very small gold key. Alice quickly took the key and tried it in all the doors, but oh dear! Either the locks were too big, or the key was too small, but she could not open any of the doors.

      Then she saw another door, a door that was only forty centimetres high. The little gold key unlocked this door easily, but of course Alice could not get through it ®C she was much too big. So she lay on the floor and looked through the open door, into a beautiful garden with green trees and bright flowers.

     Poor Alice was very unhappy. °ÆWhat a wonderful garden!°Ø she said to herself. °ÆI°Ød like to be out there ®C not in this dark room. Why can°Øt I get smaller?°Ø  It was already a very strange day, and Alice was beginning to think that anything was possible.

     After a while she locked the door again, got up and went back to the glass table. She put the key down and then she saw a little bottle on the table (°ÆI°Øm sure it wasn°Øt here before,°Ø said Alice).  Round the neck of the bottle was a piece of paper with the words DRINK ME in large letters.

     But Alice was a careful girl.  °ÆIt can be dangerous to drink out of strange bottles,°Ø she said. °ÆWhat will it do to me?°Ø She drank a little bit very slowly. The taste was very nice, like chocolate and oranges and hot sweet coffee, and very soon Alice finished the bottle.

°ÆWhat a strange feeling!°Ø said Alice.  °ÆI think I°Øm getting smaller and smaller every second.°Ø

      And she was. A few minutes later she was only twenty- five centimetres high. °ÆAnd now,°Ø she said happily, °ÆI can get through the little door into that beautiful garden.°Ø

     She ran at once to the door. When she got there, she remembered that the little gold key was back on the glass table. She ran back to the table for it, but of course, she was now much too small! There was the key, high above her, on top of the table. She tried very hard to climb up the table leg, but she could not do it.

      At last, tired and unhappy, Alice sat down on the floor and cried. But after a while she spoke to herself angrily.

      °ÆCome now,°Ø she said. °ÆStop crying at once. What°Øs the use of crying?°Ø She was a strange child, and often talked to herself like this.

      Soon she saw a little glass box near her on the floor. She opened it, and found a very small cake with the words EAT ME on it.

     Nothing could surprise Alice now. °ÆWell, I°Øll eat it,°Ø she said. °ÆIf I get taller, I can take the key off the table. And if I get smaller, I can get under the door. One way or another, I°Øll get into the garden. So it doesn°Øt matter what happens!°Ø

     She ate a bit of the cake, and then put her hand on top of her head.  °ÆWhich way?  Which way?°Ø  she asked herself, a little afraid. Nothing happened.  This was not really surprising. People don°Øt usually get taller or shorter when they eat cake. But a lot of strange things were happening to Alice today. °ÆIt will be very boring,°Ø she said, °Æif nothing happens.°Ø

      So she went on eating, and very soon the cake was finished.

Chapter two: The pool of tears
       Curiouser and curiouser!°Ø said Alice. (She was very surprised, and for a minute she forgot how to speak good English.)

      °ÆI shall be as tall as a house in a minute,°Ø she said. She tried to look down at her feet, and could only just see them. °ÆGoodbye, feet!°Ø she called. °ÆWho will put on your shoes now? Oh dear! What nonsense I°Øm talking!°Ø

     Just then her head hit the ceiling of the room. She was now about three metres high. Quickly, she took the little gold key from the table and hurried to the garden door.

     Poor Alice!  She lay on the floor and looked into the garden with one eye.  She could not even put her head through the door.

    She began to cry again, and went on crying and crying. The tears ran down her face, and soon there was a large pool of water all around her on the floor. Suddenly she heard a voice, and she stopped crying to listen.

    °ÆOh, the Duchess, the Duchess! She°Øll be so angry! I°Øm late, and she°Øs waiting for me. Oh dear, oh dear!°Ø

    It was the White Rabbit again. He was hurrying down the long room, with some white gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other hand.

     Alice was afraid, but she needed help. She spoke in a quiet voice.  °ÆOh, please, sir°™°Ø

    The Rabbit jumped wildly, dropped the gloves and the fan, and hurried away as fast as he could.

     Alice picked up the fan and the gloves. The room was very hot, so she began to fan herself while she talked. °ÆOh dear! How strange everything is today! Did I change in the night? Am I a different person today?  But if I°Øm a different person, then the next question is ®C who am I? Ah, that°Øs the mystery.°Ø

The Rabbit jumped wildly, and dropped the gloves and the fan.

     She began to feel very unhappy again, but then she looked down at her hand. She was wearing one of the Rabbit°Øs white gloves. °ÆHow did I get it on my hand?°Ø she thought.  °ÆOh, I°Øm getting smaller again!°Ø She looked round the room. °ÆI°Øm already less than a metre high. And getting smaller every second! How can I stop it?°Ø She saw the fan in her other hand, and quickly dropped it.

      She was now very, very small ®C and the little garden door was locked again, and the little gold key was lying on the glass table.

     °ÆThings are worse than ever,°Ø thought poor Alice. She turned away from the door, and fell into salt water, right up to her neck. At first she thought it was the sea, but then she saw it was the pool of tears. Her tears. Crying makes a lot of tears when you are three metres tall.

    °ÆOh, why did I cry so much?°Ø  said Alice.  She swam around and looked for a way out, but the pool was very big. Just then she saw an animal in the water near her. It looked like a large animal to Alice, but it was only a mouse.

     °ÆShall I speak to it?°Ø  thought Alice.  °ÆEverything°Øs very strange down here, so perhaps a mouse can talk.°Ø

     So she began: °ÆOh Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming, oh Mouse!°Ø (Alice did not know if this was the right way to speak to a mouse. But she wanted to be polite.)

      The mouse looked at her with its little eyes, but it said nothing.

     °ÆPerhaps it doesn°Øt understand English,°Ø thought Alice. °ÆPerhaps it°Øs a French mouse.°Ø So she began again, and said in French:  °ÆWhere is my cat?°Ø  (This was the first sentence in her French lesson-book.)

     The mouse jumped half out of the water and looked at her angrily.

    °ÆOh, I°Øm so sorry!°Ø cried Alice quickly. °ÆOf course, you don°Øt like cats, do you?°Ø

    °ÆLike cats?°Ø cried the mouse in a high,  angry voice. °ÆDoes any mouse like cats?°Ø

    °ÆWell, perhaps not,°Ø Alice began kindly.

     But the mouse was now swimming quickly away, and soon Alice was alone again.  At last she found her way out of the pool and sat down on the ground. She felt very lonely and unhappy. But after a while the White Rabbit came past again, looking for his white gloves and his fan.

    °ÆThe Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my ears and whiskers! She°Øll cut my head off, I know she will! Oh, where did I drop my gloves?°Ø Then he saw Alice. °ÆWhy, Mary Ann, what are you doing here? Run home at once, and bring me some gloves and a fan. Quick, now!°Ø

     Alice hurried away. °ÆBut where is his house?°Ø  she thought while she ran. Strangely, she was no longer in the long room with the little door, but outside in a wood. She ran and ran but could not see a house anywhere, so she sat down under a flower to rest.

Chapter three: Conversation with a caterpillar
   °∞Now,°Ø Alice said to herself. °ÆFirst, I must get a little bigger, and second, I must find my way into that beautiful garden. I think that will be the best plan. But oh dear! How shall I get bigger? Perhaps I must eat or drink something, but the question is, what?°Ø

     Alice looked all around her at the flowers and the trees, but she could not see anything to eat. Then she saw a large mushroom near her. It was as tall as she was. She walked across to look at it, and there, on top of the mushroom, was a large caterpillar, smoking a pipe. After a while, the Caterpillar took the pipe out of its mouth and said to Alice in a slow, sleepy voice, °ÆWho are you?°Ø

     °ÆI don°Øt really know, sir,°Ø said Alice. °ÆI know who I was when I got up this morning, but I have changed so often since then. I think I am a different person now.°Ø

    °ÆWhat do you mean by that?°Ø said the Caterpillar. °ÆExplain yourself!°Ø

    °ÆI can°Øt explain myself, sir,°Ø said Alice, °Æbecause I°Øm not myself, you know.°Ø

    °ÆI don°Øt know,°Ø said the Caterpillar.

English Stories to improve English - 'Explain yourself!' said the Caterpillar.
°ÆExplain yourself!°Ø said the Caterpillar.

     °ÆIt°Øs difficult to describe,°Ø Alice replied politely.  °ÆOne minute I°Øm very small, the next minute I°Øm as tall as a house, then I°Øm small again. Usually, I stay the same all day, and changing so often feels very strange to me.°Ø

      °ÆYou!°Ø said the Caterpillar, in a very unfriendly voice. °ÆWho are you?°Ø

      They were now back at the beginning of their conversation, which was not very helpful. Alice felt a little cross and decided to walk away.

      °ÆCome back!°Ø  the Caterpillar called after her. °ÆI°Øve something important to say.°Ø

      This sounded better, so Alice turned back.

     °ÆNever get angry,°Ø said the Caterpillar.

      °ÆIs that all?°Ø said Alice, trying not to be angry.

     °ÆNo,°Ø said the Caterpillar. For some minutes it smoked its pipe and did not speak, but at last it took the pipe out of its mouth, and said, °ÆSo you°Øve changed, have you? How tall do you want to be?°Ø

     °ÆI would like to be a little larger, sir, please,°Ø said Alice. °ÆEight centimetres is really very small.°Ø

     For a while the Caterpillar smoked its pipe. Then it shook itself, got down off the mushroom, and moved slowly away into the grass. It did not look back at Alice, but said, °ÆOne side will make you taller, and the other side will make you shorter.°Ø

     °ÆOne side of what?°Ø thought Alice to herself.

     She did not say this aloud, but the Caterpillar said, °ÆOf the mushroom.°Ø Then it moved away into the wood.

     Alice looked at the mushroom carefully, but it was round, and did not have sides. At last she broke off a piece in each hand from opposite sides of the mushroom. She ate some of the piece in her left hand, and waited to see what would happen.

     A minute later her head was as high as the tallest tree in the wood, and she was looking at a sea of green leaves. Then a bird appeared and began to fly around her head, screaming, °ÆEgg thief!  Egg thief! Go away!°Ø

    °ÆI°Øm not an egg thief,°Ø said Alice.

    °ÆOh no?°Ø said the bird angrily. °ÆBut you eat eggs, don°Øt you?°Ø

    °ÆWell, yes, I do, but I don°Øt steal them,°Ø explained Alice quickly. °ÆWe have them for breakfast, you know.°Ø

     °ÆThen how do you get them, if you don°Øt steal them?°Ø screamed the bird.

      This was a difficult question to answer, so Alice brought up her right hand through the leaves and ate a little from the other piece of mushroom. She began to get smaller at once and, very carefully, she ate first from one hand, then from the other, until she was about twenty- five centimetres high.

     °ÆThat°Øs better,°Ø she said to herself. °ÆAnd now I must find that garden.°Ø She began to walk through the wood, and after a while she came to a little house.

Chapter four: The Cheshire Cat
     There was a boy outside the door, with a large letter in his hand. (He was dressed like a boy, but his face was very like a fish, Alice thought.) The Fish-Boy knocked at the door, and a second later a large plate came flying out of an open window.

      °ÆA letter for the Duchess,°Ø the Fish-Boy shouted. He pushed the letter under the door and went away.

     Alice went up to the door and knocked, but there was a lot of noise inside and nobody answered. So she opened the door and walked in.

English Stories to improve English - 'A letter for the Duchess,' the Fish-Boy shouted
°ÆA letter for the Duchess,°Ø the Fish-Boy shouted

      She found herself in a kitchen, which was full of smoke. There was a very angry cook by the fire, and in the middle of the room sat the Duchess, holding a screaming baby. Every few minutes a plate crashed to the floor. There was also a large cat, which was sitting on a chair and grinning from ear to ear.

     °ÆPlease,°Ø Alice said politely to the Duchess, °Æwhy does your cat grin like that?°Ø

     °ÆIt°Øs a Cheshire Cat,°Ø said the Duchess. °ÆThat°Øs why.°Ø

     °ÆI didn°Øt know that cats could grin,°Ø said Alice.

     °ÆWell, you don°Øt know much,°Ø said the Duchess. Another plate crashed to the floor and Alice jumped. °ÆHere!°Ø the Duchess went on. °ÆYou can hold the baby for a bit, if you like. The Queen has invited me to play croquet, and I must go and get ready.°Ø She pushed the baby into Alice°Øs arms and hurried out of the room.


There was a large cat, which was grinning from ear to ear.

     °ÆOh, the poor little thing!°Ø said Alice, looking at the baby, which had a very strange face. She took it outside into the wood and walked around under the trees. Then the baby began to make strange noises, and Alice looked into its face again. Its eyes were really very small for a baby, and its nose now looked very like the nose of a pig.

      °ÆDon°Øt make noises like that, my dear,°Ø said Alice. °ÆIt°Øs not polite. You°Øre beginning to sound like a pig.°Ø

    But a few minutes later, there was no mistake. It was a pig.  Alice put it carefully on the ground, and it ran quietly away on its four legs into the wood.

    °ÆI°Øm pleased about that,°Ø Alice said to herself. °ÆIt will be a good-looking pig, but it would be terrible to be a child with a face like that.°Ø

     She was thinking about pigs and children when she suddenly saw the Cheshire Cat in a tree. The Cat grinned at her, and she went nearer to it.

    °ÆPlease,°Ø she said, °Æcan you tell me which way to go from here?°Ø

      °ÆBut where do you want to get to?°Ø said the Cat.

      °ÆIt doesn°Øt really matter°™°Ø began Alice.

      °ÆThen it doesn°Øt matter which way you go,°Ø said the Cat.

      °ÆBut I would like to get somewhere,°Ø Alice explained.

      °ÆIf you just go on walking,°Ø said the Cat, °Æin the end you°Øll arrive somewhere.°Ø

     That was true, thought Alice, but not very helpful, so she tried another question.  °ÆWhat kind of people live near here?°Ø

     °ÆTo the left,°Ø the Cat said, °Ælives a Hatter. And to the right, lives a March Hare. You can visit either of them. They°Øre both mad.°Ø

     °ÆBut I don°Øt want to visit mad people,°Ø said Alice.

     °ÆWe°Øre all mad here, you know,°Ø said the Cat. °ÆI°Øm mad. You°Øre mad.°Ø

     °ÆHow do you know that I°Øm mad?°Ø said Alice.

     °ÆOf course you°Øre mad,°Ø said the Cat.  °ÆOnly mad people come here.°Ø

     Alice was thinking about this, but the Cat went on, °ÆAre you playing croquet with the Queen today?°Ø

    °ÆI would like to very much,°Ø said Alice, °Æbut nobody has invited me yet.°Ø

    °ÆYou°Øll see me there,°Ø said the Cat, and vanished.

     Alice was not really surprised at this, because so many strange things were happening today. She was still looking at the tree when, suddenly, the Cat appeared again.

     °ÆI forgot to ask,°Ø said the Cat. °ÆWhat happened to the baby?°Ø

     °ÆIt turned into a pig,°Ø Alice said.

     °ÆI°Øm not surprised,°Ø said the Cat, and vanished again.

     Alice began to walk on, and decided to visit the March Hare. °ÆIt°Øs the month of May now,°Ø she said to herself, °Æso perhaps the Hare won°Øt be as mad as he was in March.°Ø

    Suddenly, there was the Cheshire Cat again, sitting in another tree. Alice jumped in surprise.

    °ÆDo you think,°Ø she said politely, °Æthat you could come and go more slowly?°Ø

    °ÆAll right,°Ø said the Cat. And this time it vanished very slowly. First its tail went, then its body, then its head, and last, the grin.

      °ÆWell!  I°Øve often seen a cat without a grin,°Ø thought Alice, °Æbut never a grin without a cat!°Ø

     Soon she saw the house of the March Hare in front of her.  It was a large house, so she ate a little piece of mushroom to get bigger, and walked on.


This time the Cat vanished very slowly.

Chapter five: A mad tea-party
      There was a table under a tree outside the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea. A Dormouse was sitting between them, asleep. The three of them were all sitting together at one corner of the table, but the table was large and there were many other seats. Alice sat down in a big chair at one end.

     °ÆHave some coffee,°Ø the March Hare said in a friendly voice.

     Alice looked all round the table, but she could only see a teapot. °ÆI don°Øt see any coffee,°Ø she said.

    °ÆThere isn°Øt any,°Ø said the March Hare.

     °ÆThen why did you ask me to have some?°Ø said Alice crossly. °ÆIt wasn°Øt very polite of you.°Ø

     °ÆIt wasn°Øt very polite of you to sit down. We haven°Øt invited you to tea,°Ø said the March Hare.

    °ÆBut there are lots of seats,°Ø said Alice.

    °ÆYour hair°Øs too long,°Ø said the Hatter, looking at Alice with interest.

    °ÆIt°Øs not polite to say things like that,°Ø said Alice.

    The Hatter looked surprised, but he said, °ÆWhy is a bird like a desk?°Ø

    Alice was pleased.  She enjoyed playing wordgames, so she said, °ÆThat°Øs an easy question.°Ø

    °ÆDo you mean you know the answer?°Ø said the March Hare.

    °ÆYes,°Ø said Alice.

    °ÆThen you must say what you mean,°Ø the March Hare said.

    °ÆI do,°Ø Alice said quickly. °ÆWell, I mean what I say. And that°Øs the same thing, you know.°Ø

    °ÆNo, it isn°Øt!°Ø said the Hatter. °ÆListen to this. I see what I eat means one thing, but I eat what I see means something very different.°Ø

    Alice did not know what to say to this. So she took some tea and some bread-and-butter while she thought about it. The Dormouse woke up for a minute and then went to sleep again. After a while the Hatter took out his watch, shook it, then looked at it sadly.

    °ÆTwo days slow! I told you that butter wasn°Øt good for watches!°Ø he said angrily to the March Hare.

    °ÆIt was the best butter,°Ø said the March Hare sadly.

    Alice was looking at the watch with interest.  °ÆIt°Øs a strange watch,°Ø she said. °ÆIt shows the day of the week, but not the time.°Ø

    °ÆBut we know the time,°Ø said the Hatter. °ÆIt°Øs always six o°Øclock here.°Ø

    Alice suddenly understood. °ÆIs that why there are all these cups and plates?°Ø  she said.  °ÆIt°Øs always tea-time here, and you go on moving round the table.  Is that right? But what happens when you come to the beginning again?°Ø

    °ÆDon°Øt ask questions,°Ø said the March Hare crossly. °ÆYou must tell us a story now.°Ø

    °ÆBut I don°Øt know any stories,°Ø said Alice.

    Then the March Hare and the Hatter turned to the Dormouse. °ÆWake up, Dormouse!°Ø they shouted loudly in its ears. °ÆTell us a story.°Ø

    °ÆYes, please do,°Ø said Alice.

     The Dormouse woke up and quickly began to tell a story, but a few minutes later it was asleep again. The March Hare poured a little hot tea on its nose, and the Hatter began to look for a clean plate. Alice decided to leave and walked away into the wood. She looked back once, and the March Hare and the Hatter were trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.


The March Hare poured a little hot tea on the Dormouse°Øs nose.

    °ÆWell, I won°Øt go there again,°Ø said Alice.  °ÆWhat a stupid tea-party it was!°Ø Just then she saw a door in one of the trees. °ÆHow curious!°Ø she thought. °ÆBut everything is strange today. I think I°Øll go in.°Ø

    So she went in. And there she was, back in the long room with the little glass table. At once, she picked up the gold key from the table, unlocked the little door into the garden, and then began to eat a piece of mushroom. When she was down to about thirty centimetres high, she walked through the door, and then, at last, she was in the beautiful garden with its green trees and bright flowers.

Chapter six: The Queen°Øs game of croquet
    Near the door there was a rose-tree and three gardeners, who were looking at the roses in a very worried way.

     °ÆWhat°Øs the matter?°Ø Alice said to them.

    °ÆYou see, Miss,°Ø said the first gardener, °Æthese roses are white, but the Queen only likes red roses, and she°™°Ø

    °ÆThe Queen!°Ø said the second gardener suddenly, and at once, the three gardeners lay down flat on their faces. Alice turned round and saw a great crowd of people.

     It was a pack of cards, walking through the garden. There were clubs (they were soldiers), and diamonds, and ten little children (they were hearts).  Next came some Kings and Queens. Then Alice saw the White Rabbit, and behind him, the Knave of Hearts. And last of all, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.

    When the crowd came near to Alice, they all stopped and looked at her, and the Queen said, °ÆWho are you?°Ø

    °ÆMy name is Alice, Your Majesty,°Ø said Alice very politely. But she thought to herself, °ÆThey°Øre only a pack of cards. I don°Øt need to be afraid of them!°Ø

    °ÆAnd who are these? said the Queen, looking at the three gardeners. Then she saw the white roses, and her face turned red and angry. °ÆOff with their heads!°Ø  she shouted, and soldiers hurried up to take the gardeners away. The Queen turned to Alice. °ÆCan you play croquet?°Ø she shouted.

    °ÆYes!°Ø shouted Alice.

     °ÆCome on, then!°Ø shouted the Queen. The crowd began to move on, and Alice went with them.

    °ÆIt°Øs ®C it°Øs a very fine day,°Ø said a worried voice in her ear. Alice saw that the White Rabbit was by her side.

    °ÆVery fine,°Ø said Alice. °ÆWhere°Øs the Duchess?°Ø

     °ÆShhh!°Ø  said the Rabbit in a hurried voice.  °ÆShe°Øs in prison, waiting for execution.°Ø

     °ÆWhat for?°Ø said Alice.

    But just then the Queen shouted, °ÆGet to your places!°Ø and the game began.

    It was the strangest game of croquet in Alice°Øs life! The balls were hedgehogs, and the mallets were flamingoes. And the hoops were made by soldiers, who turned over and stood on their hands and feet.  Alice held her flamingo°Øs body under her arm, but the flamingo turned its long neck first this way and then that way. At last, Alice was ready to hit the ball with the flamingo°Øs head. But by then, the hedgehog was tired of waiting and was walking away across the croquet-ground.  And when both the flamingo and the hedgehog were ready, there was no hoop! The soldiers too were always getting up and walking away.  It really was a very difficult game, Alice thought.

     The players all played at the same time, and they were always arguing and fighting for hedgehogs. Nobody could agree about anything. Very soon, the Queen was wildly angry, and went around shouting °ÆOff with his head!°Ø or °ÆOff with her head!°Ø about once a minute.

    Alice began to feel worried. °ÆThe Queen is sure to argue with me soon,°Ø she thought.  °ÆAnd what will happen to me then? They°Øre cutting people°Øs heads off all the time here. I°Øm surprised there is anyone left alive!°Ø

     Just then she saw something very strange. She watched carefully, and after a minute or two she saw that the thing was a grin. °ÆIt°Øs the Cheshire Cat,°Ø she said to herself.  °ÆNow I°Øll have somebody to talk to.°Ø   


The balls were hedgehogs, and the mallets were flamingoes

    °ÆHow are you getting on?°Ø said the Cat, when its mouth appeared.

    Alice waited. °ÆI can°Øt talk to something without ears,°Ø she thought. Slowly the Cat°Øs eyes, then its ears, and then the rest of its head appeared. But it stopped at the neck, and its body did not appear.

    Alice began to tell the Cat all about the game. °ÆIt°Øs very difficult to play,°Ø she said.  °ÆEverybody argues all the time, and the hoops and the hedgehogs walk away.°Ø

    °ÆHow do you like the Queen?°Ø said the Cat quietly.

     °ÆI don°Øt,°Ø said Alice. °ÆShe°Øs very°™°Ø Just then she saw the Queen behind her, so she went on, °Æ°™clever. She°Øs the best player here.°Ø

    The Queen smiled and walked past.

    °ÆWho are you talking to?°Ø said the King. He came up behind Alice and looked at the Cat°Øs head in surprise.

      °ÆIt°Øs a friend of mine ®C a Cheshire Cat,°Ø said Alice.

      °ÆI°Øm not sure that I like it,°Ø said the King.  °ÆBut it can touch my hand if it likes.°Ø

     °ÆI prefer not to,°Ø said the Cat.

    °ÆWell!°Ø  said the King angrily.  He called out to the Queen, °ÆMy dear! There°Øs a cat here, and I don°Øt like it.°Ø

     The Queen did not look round. °ÆOff with its head!°Ø she shouted. °ÆCall for the executioner!°Ø

      Alice was a little worried for her friend, but when the executioner arrived, everybody began to argue.

     °ÆI can°Øt cut off a head,°Ø said the executioner, °Æif there isn°Øt a body to cut it off from.°Ø

      °ÆYou can cut the head off,°Ø said the King, °Æfrom anything that°Øs got a head.°Ø

     °ÆIf somebody doesn°Øt do something quickly,°Ø said the Queen, °ÆI°Øll cut everybody°Øs head off.°Ø

      Nobody liked that plan very much, so they all turned to Alice. °ÆAnd what do you say?°Ø they cried.

     °ÆThe Cat belongs to the Duchess,°Ø said Alice carefully. °ÆPerhaps you could ask her about it.°Ø

    °ÆShe°Øs in prison,°Ø the Queen said to the executioner. °ÆBring her here at once.°Ø

     But then the Cat°Øs head slowly began to vanish, and when the executioner came back with the Duchess, there was nothing there. The King ran wildly up and down, looking for the Cat, and the Duchess put her arm round Alice. °ÆI°Øm so pleased to see you again, my dear!°Ø she said.

     °ÆLet°Øs get on with the game,°Ø the Queen said angrily, and Alice followed her back to the croquet-ground.

    The game went on, but all the time the Queen was arguing, and shouting °ÆOff with his head!°Ø or °ÆOff with her head!°Ø  Soon there were no hoops left, because the soldiers (who were the hoops) were too busy taking everybody to prison.  And at the end there were only three players left ®C the King, the Queen, and Alice.

     The Queen stopped shouting and said to Alice, °ÆHave you seen the Mock Turtle yet?°Ø

    °ÆNo,°Ø said Alice. °ÆI°Øm not sure what a Mock Turtle is.°Ø

    °ÆThen come with me,°Ø said the Queen.

    They found the Mock Turtle down by the sea. Next to him was a Gryphon, asleep in the sun. Then the Queen hurried away, saying, °ÆI have to get on with some executions.°Ø

    The Gryphon woke up, and said sleepily to Alice, °ÆIt°Øs just talk, you know. They never execute anybody.°Ø

    Alice was pleased to hear this. She felt a little afraid of the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle, because they were so large. But they were very friendly, and sang songs and told her many stories about their lives. The Mock Turtle was in the middle of a very sad song when they all heard a shout a long way away: °ÆIt°Øs beginning!°Ø °ÆCome on! We must hurry!°Ø cried the Gryphon. It took Alice by the hand and began to run.


The Mock Turtle and the Gryphon were very friendly.

Chapter seven: Who stole the tarts?
      The King and Queen of Hearts were sitting on their thrones when Alice and the Gryphon arrived. There was a great crowd of birds and animals, and all the pack of cards.

    Soldiers stood all around the Knave of Hearts, and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand.

    In the middle of the room there was a table, with a large plate of tarts on it. °ÆThey look good,°Ø thought Alice, who was feeling a little hungry.

     Then the White Rabbit called out loudly, °ÆSilence! The trial of the Knave of Hearts will now begin!°Ø He took out a long piece of paper, and read:

The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,

All on a summer day.

The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,

And took them all away.

        °ÆVery good,°Ø said the King. °ÆCall the first witness.°Ø

    Alice looked at the jury, who were now writing everything down. It was a very strange jury. Some of the jurymen were animals, and the others were birds.

     Then the White Rabbit blew his trumpet three times, and called out, °ÆFirst witness!°Ø

    The first witness was the Hatter.  He came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other hand.  °ÆI°Øm very sorry, Your Majesty,°Ø he said.  °ÆI was in the middle of tea when the trial began.°Ø

     °ÆTake off your hat,°Ø the King said.

     °ÆIt isn°Øt mine,°Ø said the Hatter.

    °ÆStolen! Write that down,°Ø the King said to the jury.

     °ÆI keep hats to sell,°Ø explained the Hatter. °ÆI don°Øt have a hat myself. I°Øm a Hatter.°Ø

     °ÆGive your evidence,°Ø said the King, °Æor we°Øll cut your head off.°Ø

    The Hatter°Øs face turned white. °ÆI°Øm a poor man, Your Majesty,°Ø he began, in a shaking voice.

     Just then Alice had a strange feeling. After a minute or two she understood what it was.

    °ÆDon°Øt push like that,°Ø said the Dormouse, who was sitting next to her. °ÆI°Øm nearly falling off my seat.°Ø

     °ÆI°Øm very sorry,°Ø Alice said politely. °ÆI°Øm getting bigger and taller, you see.°Ø

     °ÆWell, you can°Øt do that here,°Ø said the Dormouse crossly, and he got up and moved to another seat.

    The Hatter was still giving evidence, but nobody could understand a word of it. The King looked at the Queen, and the Queen looked at the executioner.

     The unhappy Hatter saw this, and dropped his bread- and-butter.  °ÆI°Øm a poor man, Your Majesty,°Ø he said again.

    °ÆYou°Øre a very poor speaker,°Ø said the King. He turned to the White Rabbit. °ÆCall the next witness,°Ø he said.

    The next witness was the Duchess°Øs cook, who spoke very angrily and said  that  she  would  not  give  any evidence. The King looked worried and told the White Rabbit to call another witness. Alice watched while the White Rabbit looked at the names on his piece of paper. Then, to her great surprise, he called out loudly, °ÆAlice!°Ø °ÆHere!°Ø cried Alice, jumping to her feet.

     °ÆHere!°Ø cried Alice, jumping to her feet.

     °ÆWhat do you know about these tarts?°Ø said the King.

     °ÆNothing,°Ø said Alice.

     The Queen was looking hard at Alice. Now she said,

     °ÆAll people a mile high must leave the room.°Ø

     °ÆI°Øm not a mile high,°Ø said Alice. °ÆAnd I won°Øt leave the room. I want to hear the evidence.°Ø

    °ÆThere is no more evidence,°Ø said the King very quickly, °Æand now the jury will°™°Ø

     °ÆYour Majesty!°Ø said the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry.  °ÆWe°Øve just found this letter. There°Øs no name on it, but I think the Knave wrote it.°Ø

    °ÆNo, I didn°Øt!°Ø said the Knave loudly.

    °ÆRead it to us,°Ø said the King.

    °ÆWhere shall I begin, Your Majesty?°Ø asked the Rabbit.

    °ÆBegin at the beginning,°Ø said the King, °Æand go on until you get to the end, then stop.°Ø

    Everybody listened very carefully while the White Rabbit read these words.

They tell me you have been to her,

And talked of me to him.

She thought I was a gardener,

But said I could not swim.

He tells them that I have not gone,

(We know that this is true).

If she decide to hurry on,

What will they do to you?

I gave her one, they gave him two,

You gave us three or more.

They all returned from him to you,

But they were mine before.

   °ÆThat°Øs a very important piece of evidence,°Ø said the King. He looked very pleased. °ÆNow the jury must°™°Ø

     °ÆIf anybody in the jury can explain that letter,°Ø said Alice (she was not afraid of anything now, because she was much bigger than everybody in the room), °ÆI°Øll give him sixpence. It°Øs all nonsense! It doesn°Øt mean anything.°Ø

    The jury busily wrote this down.  °ÆShe thinks it°Øs all nonsense.°Ø

     °ÆAll nonsense, eh?°Ø said the King. He read some of the words again. °ÆBut said I could not swim. You can°Øt swim, can you?°Ø he said to the Knave.

    The Knave°Øs face was sad. °ÆDo I look like a swimmer?°Ø he said. (And he didn°Øt ®C because he was made of paper.)

     The King smiled. °ÆI understand everything now,°Ø he said. °ÆThere are the tarts, and here is the Knave of Hearts. And now the jury must decide who the thief is.°Ø

    °ÆNo, no!°Ø said the Queen. °ÆOff with his head! The jury can say what it thinks later.°Ø

    °ÆWhat nonsense!°Ø said Alice loudly. °ÆThe jury must decide first. You can°Øt°™°Ø

    °ÆBe quiet!°Ø said the Queen, her face turning red.

    °ÆI won°Øt!°Ø said Alice.

    °ÆOff with her head!°Ø  screamed the Queen.  Nobody moved.

    °ÆIt doesn°Øt matter what you say,°Ø said Alice.  °ÆYou°Øre only a pack of cards!°Ø

    Then the pack of cards flew up into the sky and began to fall on Alice°Øs face. She gave a little scream . . . and woke up. She was lying next to her sister under the trees, and some leaves were falling on her face.

    °ÆWake up, Alice dear,°Ø said her sister.  °ÆYou°Øve been asleep a long time.°Ø

    °ÆOh, I°Øve had a very curious dream!°Ø  said Alice, and she told her sister all about the strange adventures in her wonderful dream.






























Hello everyone, I am Wu Haoxuan from Class 9, Grade 7. Welcome to Jinji Lake School!
Our school is located in Suzhou, next to Jinji Lake. It is large and beautiful. There are six classroom buildings and four gardens between our classroom buildings. My friends and I often play tag in these gardens after school.
Additionally, our school has a gym called Kunpeng Stadium. Sometimes, we have our PE lessons there. We also have a sports field where we hold most of our outdoor lessons. Sports meetings are also held on the sports field. In front of the gym, there is a small pond with some fish in it.
My favorite place in the school is the forest area. There are many trees in our school, and we have a great time under their shade. Some classmates and I would like to see more trees planted in our school because they have a pleasant smell and are good for our eyes.
In the center of our school, there is a library named Lianghu Academy. That is where we read books.
This is our school; would you like to join Jinji Lake School?
