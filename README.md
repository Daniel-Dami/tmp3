# tmp3
Tmp3 is a small language model made with C++ in 100 lines. It can basically speek human language, but with some grammar mistakes. Made for fun.

It's not a full AI now. Can you help me enhance it?

Besides, the training data has some problems.

When you're trying to open the executable and an alert shows up, click "More Info" and then click "Run Anyways".
